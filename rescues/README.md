# PMD RT:DX Rescue Code Generator
This is my attempt at a rescue code generator for Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX. This is very much a work in progress, and in fact does not work at all yet.

## Background


## Testing
Run `pytest test.py` to run tests (right now it's just tests that I reimplemented the .NET PRNG correctly).


## Credits
This makes heavy use of the instructions at [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/zaksabeast/fed5730156e26fb3e805e234fcbea60b) by zaksabeast, so thank you. Some anonymous person also created a decoder at http://136.144.185.148/pmdrtdx/, which has helped me validate passwords, so thank you as well.
